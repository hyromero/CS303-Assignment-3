Assignment 3 

STEPS: 

1. Queue Instantiation: The program first instantiates a queue of integers (Queue<int> q;).

2. Push Operation: The program pushes 10 values (1 through 10) into the queue using the push() method.

3. Display Queue: After pushing the 10 values, the program displays the elements of the queue using the display() method.

4. Pop Operation: After displaying the initial queue, the program pops the front element from the queue using the pop() method, and then displays the updated state of the queue.

5. Push Another Value: The program pushes the value 11 into the queue, and displays the new state of the queue after the insertion.

6. Move Front Element to Rear: The program then calls move_to_rear() to move the front element to the rear of the queue and displays the updated state.

7. Linear Search: The program performs a recursive linear search to find the last occurrence of the target value 2 in a predefined vector using the linear_search_last() method.

8. Insertion Sort: Finally, the program uses the insertion_sort() method to sort the elements in the queue and displays the queue after sorting.
